**Go-Specific Instructions:**

1.  **Standard Library:** Prefer the standard library over third-party packages for common tasks.
2.  **Error Handling:** Use idiomatic `if err != nil` error handling.
3.  **Formatting:** All code must be formatted with `gofmt` or `goimports`.
4.  **Modules:** Be mindful of the `go.mod` file for dependencies and module paths.
5.  **Concurrency:** When suggesting concurrent code, use channels and goroutines safely and explain potential race conditions.
